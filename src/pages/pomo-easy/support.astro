              <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-[var(--text-primary)] mb-2">What is the Pomodoro Technique?</h3>
              <p class="text-[var(--text-secondary)]">The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes of focused work followed by a 5-minute break. After four work intervals (called "pomodoros"), you take a longer break of 15-30 minutes. The technique helps maintain focus and prevents burnout.</p>

            <div>
              <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-[var(--text-primary)] mb-2">Why 25 minutes?</h3>
              <p class="text-[var(--text-secondary)]">25 minutes is long enough to make meaningful progress on a task, but short enough to maintain concentration without mental fatigue. It's also easy to estimate — you can plan your day in pomodoro-sized chunks. That said, Pomo Easy lets you customize the duration if 25 minutes doesn't work for you.</p>

              <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-[var(--text-primary)] mb-2">What should I do during breaks?</h3>
              <p class="text-[var(--text-secondary)]">Step away from your work. Stand up, stretch, get water, look out the window, or take a short walk. The key is to give your brain a genuine rest — avoid checking email or social media, as these can be cognitively demanding. The break should feel refreshing, not draining.</p>

            <div>
              <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-[var(--text-primary)] mb-2">What if I'm in the zone and don't want to stop?</h3>
              <p class="text-[var(--text-secondary)]">This is a common dilemma. Purists say you should always take the break to prevent burnout. Pragmatists say if you're deeply focused, extend the session. Pomo Easy doesn't force you either way — you can skip or extend as needed. Over time, you'll develop intuition for when to push through and when to rest.</p>

              <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-[var(--text-primary)] mb-2">How does Focus Mode integration work?</h3>
              <p class="text-[var(--text-secondary)]">When enabled, Pomo Easy can automatically activate an iOS Focus Mode during your work sessions. This silences notifications and helps you stay focused. The Focus automatically deactivates when your work interval ends. You can choose which Focus Mode to use in the app settings.</p>

              <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-[var(--text-primary)] mb-2">What are Live Activities?</h3>
              <p class="text-[var(--text-secondary)]">Live Activities show your running timer on the Lock Screen and in the Dynamic Island (on supported iPhones). This lets you see your remaining time at a glance without unlocking your phone or opening the app. It's a great way to stay aware of your timer without breaking focus.</p>
