            <div>
              <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-[var(--text-primary)] mb-2">How do I set my daily hydration goal?</h3>
              <p class="text-[var(--text-secondary)] leading-relaxed">Go to Settings and tap on "Daily Goal." You can choose from common presets or enter a custom amount. The app supports both ounces and milliliters — just set your preferred unit in Settings.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-[var(--text-primary)] mb-2">What's a good daily water intake goal?</h3>
              <p class="text-[var(--text-secondary)] leading-relaxed">A common recommendation is 64 ounces (about 2 liters) per day, but this varies based on your body size, activity level, climate, and health conditions. The default goal of 64oz is a good starting point for most adults. Consult your doctor for personalized advice.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-[var(--text-primary)] mb-2">How do I set up reminders?</h3>
              <p class="text-[var(--text-secondary)] leading-relaxed">Go to Settings and tap on "Reminders." You can set the time range for reminders (e.g., 8 AM to 8 PM) and how often you'd like to be reminded. Hydrate will send you gentle notifications throughout the day to help you stay on track.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-[var(--text-primary)] mb-2">Can I log drinks other than water?</h3>
              <p class="text-[var(--text-secondary)] leading-relaxed">Hydrate is designed specifically for water tracking. While other beverages do contribute to hydration, water is the gold standard. You can certainly log other hydrating beverages if you'd like — just tap the amount you consumed.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-[var(--text-primary)] mb-2">How do I add widgets to my Home Screen?</h3>
              <p class="text-[var(--text-secondary)] leading-relaxed">Long-press on your Home Screen, tap the "+" button in the top corner, search for "Hydrate," and choose your preferred widget size. For Lock Screen widgets, go to Settings → Wallpaper → Customize Lock Screen, and add a Hydrate widget.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-[var(--text-primary)] mb-2">Does Hydrate sync with Apple Health?</h3>
              <p class="text-[var(--text-secondary)] leading-relaxed">Yes! Go to Settings and enable "HealthKit Sync." Hydrate will write your water intake to Apple Health as dietary water data. This is completely optional — the app works perfectly fine without it.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-[var(--text-primary)] mb-2">How do streaks work?</h3>
              <p class="text-[var(--text-secondary)] leading-relaxed">Your streak counts consecutive days where you hit your daily goal. Miss a day, and your streak resets to zero. But don't worry — your longest streak is saved forever, so you always have a record to beat!</p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-[var(--text-primary)] mb-2">Can I edit or delete past entries?</h3>
              <p class="text-[var(--text-secondary)] leading-relaxed">Yes. Go to the History tab, find the entry you want to modify, and swipe left to delete it. You can also tap on any day to see detailed entries for that day.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-[var(--text-primary)] mb-2">Does Hydrate work on Apple Watch?</h3>
              <p class="text-[var(--text-secondary)] leading-relaxed">Yes! Install the watch app from the Watch app on your iPhone. You can log water directly from your wrist and add complications to your watch face to see your progress at a glance.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-[var(--text-primary)] mb-2">Is my data backed up?</h3>
              <p class="text-[var(--text-secondary)] leading-relaxed">Your Hydrate data is included in your iPhone backup (iCloud or computer). If you restore your phone from backup, your hydration history will come with it. We don't have access to your data — it never leaves your device.</p>
