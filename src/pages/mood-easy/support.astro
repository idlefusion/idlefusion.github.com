            <div>
              <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-[var(--text-primary)] mb-2">How do I log my mood?</h3>
              <p class="text-[var(--text-secondary)] leading-relaxed">Open Mood Easy and tap one of the five emoji buttons that best represents how you're feeling — great, good, okay, bad, or awful. You can optionally add a short note, then tap save. That's it!</p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-[var(--text-primary)] mb-2">Can I change a mood entry?</h3>
              <p class="text-[var(--text-secondary)] leading-relaxed">Yes! Tap on any day in the calendar view to see your entry. You can edit the mood or note at any time.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-[var(--text-primary)] mb-2">What is Year in Pixels?</h3>
              <p class="text-[var(--text-secondary)] leading-relaxed">Year in Pixels is a visual calendar where each day is represented by a colored square based on your mood. Over time, you'll see patterns emerge — good streaks, tough weeks, and everything in between. It's a gentle way to gain self-insight without over-analyzing.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-[var(--text-primary)] mb-2">Is my mood data private?</h3>
              <p class="text-[var(--text-secondary)] leading-relaxed">Completely. Your mood entries are stored only on your device. There are no accounts, no cloud sync, and no data collection. We never see your moods. When you delete the app, your data is permanently gone.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-[var(--text-primary)] mb-2">What about HealthKit?</h3>
              <p class="text-[var(--text-secondary)] leading-relaxed">Mood Easy can optionally sync with Apple Health's State of Mind feature, letting you see your moods alongside other wellness data. This is entirely optional — you control permissions, and HealthKit data stays on your device just like the rest.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-[var(--text-primary)] mb-2">How do widgets work?</h3>
              <p class="text-[var(--text-secondary)] leading-relaxed">Long-press your home screen, tap the + button, and find Mood Easy. We offer a small widget that prompts you to log, a medium widget showing your last 7 days, and a lock screen widget showing today's mood.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-[var(--text-primary)] mb-2">Can I set reminders?</h3>
              <p class="text-[var(--text-secondary)] leading-relaxed">Yes. Go to Settings within the app to enable gentle daily reminders. You can choose the time that works best for you. These reminders are generated locally on your device.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-[var(--text-primary)] mb-2">Does the Apple Watch app sync with iPhone?</h3>
              <p class="text-[var(--text-secondary)] leading-relaxed">Yes. Mood entries made on your Apple Watch automatically sync to your iPhone using Apple's built-in Watch Connectivity, keeping both devices up to date.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-[var(--text-primary)] mb-2">Why are there no red colors for bad moods?</h3>
              <p class="text-[var(--text-secondary)] leading-relaxed">We use calming, non-judgmental colors throughout Mood Easy. Even difficult days should feel okay to track. Our palette is designed to be gentle and supportive, not alarming.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-[var(--text-primary)] mb-2">I'm having thoughts of self-harm. Can this app help?</h3>
              <p class="text-[var(--text-secondary)] leading-relaxed">Mood Easy is a simple tracking tool, not a replacement for professional support. If you're struggling, please reach out to a mental health professional or crisis line. In the US, you can call or text 988 to reach the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline. You matter, and help is available.</p>
